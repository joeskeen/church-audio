# church-audio

This project is designed to be a place where URLs to Church audio files can be aggregated into convenient formats, such as M3U playlists and podcast RSS feeds.

Missing something? Links broken? Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

I do not own the rights to any of the audio files linked here, and I do not claim to. This is simply a place to aggregate links to audio files that are already available on the internet. As such, this project has a [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal License (public domain)](./LICENSE).

## M3U Playlists

`m3u` files in this repository are playlists with one URL per line.

## Testing

In the .testing directory, there are some PowerShell Core (cross-platform) Pester tests that validate the data in this repository. If you have PowerShell Core installed you can run the `.testing/Run-Tests.ps1` file to run those tests.
